                * String
                - create string
                - methods
                - manipulation
        How do we create String?
                - Literal
                        - new Keyword :
                Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in) ---> creates an object of JAVA in the memory
        String str = new String("EU9 rocks");
        Java Compiler checks the String Pool. And if there is already a string in the pool, Java does not create a new one.
                str1: reference to our String object, referenceName of Object, variableName
        str2: reference to our String object --> Address or pointer to object
        ArrayList, Collections, OOP topics: object equality and content (data) equality not same thing
                * Strings are indexed based
        "Java";
        0123  ---> last index 3
        length() returns 4 for this example
        For ALL methods that we learn: Oscar Recommends (OR)
                make a note paper: what methods ask from me (parameter)
        what will this method return to me

        - Debug mode of IntelliJ helps you to go over your CODE line by line
